# Hospital_Management_System
A Hospital Management System is a software application designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a hospital or healthcare facility. It can help automate administrative tasks, streamline patient care, and improve the overall efficiency of a hospital.

The Hospital Management System you described is built using PostgresSQL, Flask, HTML, and CSS. PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source database management system that is used to store and retrieve data. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web application framework written in Python that is used to build the backend of the system. HTML and CSS are used to create the frontend, which is the user interface that hospital staff will use to interact with the system.

The system can have several modules such as:

Patient management: registration, admission, discharge, billing, and medical history.
Doctor management: appointment scheduling, prescription management, patient diagnosis and treatment.
Staff management: roles, work schedules, attendance tracking, payroll.
Inventory management: tracking of medical supplies, medicines, and equipment.
Accounting: revenue management, expense management, financial reporting.
Reporting: generating reports based on various data points for management.
The system allows authorized users to access the relevant modules, add or update information, and view reports. The system can also have security features such as role-based access control and user authentication.

In summary, a Hospital Management System built using PostgreSQL, Flask, HTML, and CSS is a powerful tool that can help healthcare facilities manage their operations efficiently and improve patient care.
